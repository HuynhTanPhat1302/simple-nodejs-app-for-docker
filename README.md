## Installation

Prerequisite:
- Docker on the local machine
- Docker Hub account
- Dockerfile (Dockerfile is needed to be suitable for the platform you are using)

Step 1: Build the application with the docker

Change directory to the root directory of the node.js application
```sh
  cd /path-to-node.js-app/
```

Build and tag the application
```sh
  docker build -t bongu1302/demo:v2 .
```

Check whether the application is built or not:
```sh
  docker images
```


Step 2: Run the application

```sh
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 bongu1302/demo:v1
```

Notes that -d is run docker in background, flag -p stands for port

Check container is running or not, When the app is built, it is called an image, when we run the image, it is called the container
```sh
  docker ps
```

Step 3: Push the image to Docker Hub

```sh
  docker push bongu1302/demo:v1
```
